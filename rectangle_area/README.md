# Rectangle Area

Implement a **Rectangle** class which include the following attributes and methods:

  1. Two public attributes width and height.

  2. A constructor which expects two parameters *width* and *height* of type int.

  3. A method **getArea** which would calculate the size of the rectangle and return.

## Example

```
Rectangle rec = new Rectangle(3, 4);
rec.getArea(); // should get 12
```
